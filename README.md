# malekaiNews
Crowfall makes things incredibly difficult by not offering an RSS feed of their news articles. To help the community with this, we put together malekaiNews which collects this information and collates it together for use by all. Able to be subscribed to by malekaiDiscord (""@malekaiBot subscribe news") in your own server!

Note: This uses some hijinkery to work, mostly DOM traversals, with a rather inelegant CSS design source material as reference. Crowfall.com doesn't label things with traditional css labels, or id's, making this mostly hacked together from guesswork and luck. Hopefully they fix this and offer an RSS feed or improve css class names/attributes.
